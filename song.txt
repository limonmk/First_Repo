Looking out on the morning rain
I used to feel so uninspired
And when I knew I had to face another day
Lord, it made me feel so tired

Before the day I met you
Life was so unkind
You're the key
To my piece of mind

'Cause you make me feel
You make me feel
You make me feel
Like a natural woman

Now I'm no longer doubtful
Of what I'm livin' for
And if I make you happy
I don't need to do more
